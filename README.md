# react-material-demo  -  A Martial Arts Club Demo

An example of using React with Material Ui - 
A demo api to generate random JSON data to reflect an api can be found at 

https://next.json-generator.com/api/json/get/EkYY3zvES

  If your a beginer and JSON don't mean anything to you. Then do the following:

  1) Copy the random looking text from this link https://next.json-generator.com/api/json/get/EkYY3zvES

  2) Visit a JSON formatter service on the web like https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/
     and paste the text in there to 'Process'. Look at the results and compare them to the original. 
     Do you see any patterns ? Does the original file reflect anything in the tree structure ? 
     Use Google or YouTube to research.
